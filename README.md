## Why?

A forever in progress project.

I like to build stuff, and this is a way for me to experiment and build stuff.

## What?

A project management tool. 

Some features i like about Asana/BaseCamp/Notion/Monday i like to build for myself. The idea behind this is to gain experience in the front-end and the back-end.

## Front-End

- Vue
- TypeScript

## Back-end

- NodeJS
- Express
